Everything you need to know to work a forge -- how to smelt ores into pure metal, how to turn that metal into arms and armour, and how to imbue the equipment you make with magical power. Knowing how this equipment is made also helps you identify it in the field.
Active (Int): Identify weapons and armour.
Crafting (Forge): Create enchanted weapons and armour.
