The magical discipline of Summoning lets you call forth physical objects, ranging from crossbow bolts to living elementals. It is still an open question whether they are brought to the caster from some distant locale, or created ex nihilo by the caster's will.
Passive (Int): Allows you to learn and cast Summoning spells.
