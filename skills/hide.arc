The art of moving unseen and unheard, allowing you to sneak past enemies without attracting their notice. Unlike magical invisibility, this can be attempted even in null-magic areas, but is also likely to fail if you move around too much, or stand in the open or near bright lights.
Active (Dex): Attempt to conceal yourself temporarily.
