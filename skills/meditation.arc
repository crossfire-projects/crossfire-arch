Meditative techniques allow you to seek inner peace even in on the battlefield, rapidly replenishing your spiritual power and, to a lesser extent, accelerating healing. While novices will need to put down their weapons and strip off cumbersome armour, with practice you can learn to meditate even in full plate.
Active: Rapidly regain SP and HP.
