## On average, a mountain tile will have 3.61 mines in it.
## Some will have none. Many will have one or two.
## Very, very few will have 11.
## And, unlike before, a given mining tile will give a mishmash of stuff instead of the same thing repeatedly.
## Part of this is due to the inability of rubble containers to stack in multiples, since opening one empties the inventory of all.
## So we have individual entries here as a workaround.
## This should solve the exceedingly exploitable infinite gold nugget abuse I figured out earlier
