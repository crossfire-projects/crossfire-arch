Your study of magic has been obsessive.  Your frequent practice has greatly enhanced your powers, and your intellect has been sharpened enormously by your quest for ever better ways to channel energies. Those who used to mock your frailty now fear your magical prowess.
On the other hand, you have totally neglected physical training. You are soft and weak, and have no knowledge of weaponry.
Your study of magical devices allows you to notice when an object has a magical aura, and you are often able to fathom the purpose of magical devices.
