# Starting skill packages for players.
# Note that these are also used by some monsters, e.g. the "elf" list references
# both fighter_skills and wizard_skills and is used by a number of elven
# enemies.
# It might someday be a good idea to split those lists off from here so player
# skill packages can be tweaked without adding/removing skills on a bunch of
# monsters as well.

# Basic skills. All* players will start with these skills, so only skills
# critical for being able to play should go here.
#
# * Exception: Barbarians get their own skill package based on a copy of this,
#   so that Literacy and Use Magic Item can be removed. If editing this list
#   make sure to update barbarian.trs as well, if needed.
